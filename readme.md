# Album sharing social platform

### Details
This is a web database management project for my CSCI 130 course (Fall, 2024). 
The project utalizes JS, HTML/CSS, PHP, and SQL for an album management social
platform.

### Base Functionality
The aim is to utalize an album API, to store user selected albums in a sql database. Users will be able to store/share their favorite (Or least favorite) albums to their page, and give their own personal reviews and opinions. 

Users will be able to create accounts, and maintain their pages, with an about me section, a list of albums they've reviewed, along with their current favorite album.

### Inspiration
As a music lover, this project idea stood out to me as a way for other music enthusiest to share their music opinions or hot takes.

### Future
I'd like to eventually expand this to include songs as well. Users will eventually be able to have a friends list, and be able to share collections of their 
recent finds/listens in a post similar to instagram, with comments and sharing being a component.
